Introduction
Prerequisites
This tutorial assumes RabbitMQ is installed and running on localhost on standard port (5672). In case you use a different host, port or credentials, connections settings would require adjusting.

Where to get help
If you're having trouble going through this tutorial you can contact us through the mailing list.

RabbitMQ is a message broker: it accepts and forwards messages. You can think about it as a post office: when you put the mail that you want posting in a post box, you can be sure that Mr. or Ms. Mailperson will eventually deliver the mail to your recipient. In this analogy, RabbitMQ is a post box, a post office and a postman.

The major difference between RabbitMQ and the post office is that it doesn't deal with paper, instead it accepts, stores and forwards binary blobs of data â€’ messages.

RabbitMQ, and messaging in general, uses some jargon.

Producing means nothing more than sending. A program that sends messages is a producer :


A queue is the name for a post box which lives inside RabbitMQ. Although messages flow through RabbitMQ and your applications, they can only be stored inside a queue. A queue is only bound by the host's memory & disk limits, it's essentially a large message buffer. Many producers can send messages that go to one queue, and many consumers can try to receive data from one queue. This is how we represent a queue:


Consuming has a similar meaning to receiving. A consumer is a program that mostly waits to receive messages:


Note that the producer, consumer, and broker do not have to reside on the same host; indeed in most applications they don't. An application can be both a producer and consumer, too.

"Hello World"
(using Spring AMQP)
In this part of the tutorial we'll write two programs using the spring-amqp library; a producer that sends a single message, and a consumer that receives messages and prints them out. We'll gloss over some of the detail in the Spring AMQP API, concentrating on this very simple thing just to get started. It's a "Hello World" of messaging.

In the diagram below, "P" is our producer and "C" is our consumer. The box in the middle is a queue - a message buffer that RabbitMQ keeps on behalf of the consumer.

(P) -> [|||] -> (C)
The Spring AMQP Framework
RabbitMQ speaks multiple protocols. This tutorial uses AMQP 0-9-1, which is an open, general-purpose protocol for messaging. There are a number of clients for RabbitMQ in many different languages.

We'll be using Spring Boot to bootstrap and configure our Spring AMQP project. We chose Maven to build the project, but we could have used Gradle as well.

The source code of the project is available online, but you can also do the tutorials from scratch.

If you choose the later, open the Spring Initializr and provide: the group id (e.g. org.springframework.amqp.tutorials) the artifact id (e.g. rabbitmq-amqp-tutorials) Search for the RabbitMQ dependency and select the RabbitMQ dependency.

(P) ->  [|||]
Generate the project and unzip the generated project into the location of your choice. This can now be imported into your favorite IDE. Alternatively you can work on it from your favorite editor.

Configuring the project
Spring Boot offers numerous features but we will only highlight a few here. First, Spring Boot applications have the option of providing their properties through either an application.properties or application.yml file (there are many more options as well but this will get us going). You'll find an application.properties file in the generated project with nothing in it. Rename application.properties to application.yml file with the following properties:

spring:
  profiles:
    active: usage_message

logging:
  level:
    org: ERROR

tutorial:
  client:
    duration: 10000
Create a new package tut1 where we can put the tutorial code. We'll now create a Java configuration file Tut1Config.java to describe our Spring beans in the following manner:

package org.springframework.amqp.tutorials.tut1;

import org.springframework.amqp.core.Queue;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Profile;

@Profile({"tut1","hello-world"})
@Configuration
public class Tut1Config {

    @Bean
    public Queue hello() {
        return new Queue("hello");
    }

    @Profile("receiver")
    @Bean
    public Tut1Receiver receiver() {
        return new Tut1Receiver();
    }

    @Profile("sender")
    @Bean
    public Tut1Sender sender() {
        return new Tut1Sender();
    }
}
Note that we've defined the first tutorial profile as either tut1, the package name, or hello-world. We use the @Configuration annotation to let Spring know that this is a Java Configuration and in it we create the definition for our Queue ("hello") and define our Sender and Receiver beans.

We will run all of our tutorials through the Boot Application now by simply passing in which profiles we are using. To enable this we will modify the generated RabbitAmqpTutorialsApplication class with the following:

import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Profile;
import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.EnableScheduling;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableScheduling
public class RabbitAmqpTutorialsApplication {

    @Profile("usage_message")
    @Bean
    public CommandLineRunner usage() {
        return args -> {
            System.out.println("This app uses Spring Profiles to
                control its behavior.\n");
            System.out.println("Sample usage: java -jar
                rabbit-tutorials.jar
                --spring.profiles.active=hello-world,sender");
        };
    }

    @Profile("!usage_message")
    @Bean
    public CommandLineRunner tutorial() {
        return new RabbitAmqpTutorialsRunner();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        SpringApplication.run(RabbitAmqpTutorialsApplication.class, args);
    }
}
and add the RabbitAmqpTutorialsRunner class as follows:

package org.springframework.amqp.tutorials;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner;
import org.springframework.context.ConfigurableApplicationContext;

public class RabbitAmqpTutorialsRunner implements CommandLineRunner {

    @Value("${tutorial.client.duration:0}")
    private int duration;

    @Autowired
    private ConfigurableApplicationContext ctx;

    @Override
    public void run(String... arg0) throws Exception {
        System.out.println("Ready ... running for " + duration + "ms");
        Thread.sleep(duration);
        ctx.close();
    }
}
Sending
(P) -> [|||]
Now there is very little code that needs to go into the sender and receiver classes. Let's call them Tut1Receiver and Tut1Sender. The sender leverages our configuration and the RabbitTemplate to send the message.

// Sender
package org.springframework.amqp.tutorials.tut1;

import org.springframework.amqp.core.Queue;
import org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.core.RabbitTemplate;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.Scheduled;

public class Tut1Sender {

    @Autowired
    private RabbitTemplate template;

    @Autowired
    private Queue queue;

    @Scheduled(fixedDelay = 1000, initialDelay = 500)
    public void send() {
        String message = "Hello World!";
        this.template.convertAndSend(queue.getName(), message);
        System.out.println(" [x] Sent '" + message + "'");
    }
}
You'll notice that Spring AMQP removes the boiler plate code leaving you with only the logic of the messaging to be concerned about. We autowire in the queue that was configured in our bean definition in the Tut1Config class and like many spring connection abstractions, we wrap the boilerplate RabbitMQ client classes with a RabbitTemplate that can be autowired into the sender. All that is left is to create a message and invoke the template's convertAndSend method passing in the queue name from the bean we defined and the message we just created.

Sending doesn't work!
If this is your first time using RabbitMQ and you don't see the "Sent" message then you may be left scratching your head wondering what could be wrong. Maybe the broker was started without enough free disk space (by default it needs at least 200 MB free) and is therefore refusing to accept messages. Check the broker logfile to confirm and reduce the limit if necessary. The configuration file documentation will show you how to set disk_free_limit.

Receiving
The receiver is equally simple. We annotate our receiver class with @RabbitListener and pass in the name of the queue. We then annotate our receive method with @RabbitHandler passing in the payload that has been pushed to the queue.

package org.springframework.amqp.tutorials.tut1;

import org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.annotation.RabbitHandler;
import org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.annotation.RabbitListener;

@RabbitListener(queues = "hello")
public class Tut1Receiver {

    @RabbitHandler
    public void receive(String in) {
        System.out.println(" [x] Received '" + in + "'");
    }
}
Putting it all together
We must now build the JAR file:

./mvnw clean package
The application uses Spring Profiles to control what tutorial it's running, and whether it's a sender or receiver. To run the receiver, execute the following command:

# consumer
java -jar target/rabbitmq-tutorials.jar --spring.profiles.active=hello-world,receiver
Open another shell to run the sender:

# sender
java -jar target/rabbitmq-tutorials.jar --spring.profiles.active=hello-world,sender
Listing queues
You may wish to see what queues RabbitMQ has and how many messages are in them. You can do it (as a privileged user) using the rabbitmqctl tool:

sudo rabbitmqctl list_queues
On Windows, omit the sudo:

rabbitmqctl.bat list_queues
Time to move on to part 2 and build a simple work queue.
